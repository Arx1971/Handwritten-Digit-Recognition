## Hand Written Digit Recognition Using Supervised Machine Learning

#### AUC - ROC

AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for classicication problem. a varuous thresholds setting.s ROC is probability curve and AUC represetns degree of measure of separability. It tells how much model is capable of distinghuishing between classes. Higher the AUC, btter the model is at predictiong 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. The ROC curve is plotted with TPR against the DPR where TPR is on y-axis and FPR is on the x-axis.
